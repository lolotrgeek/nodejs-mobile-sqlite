relies on nodejs-mobile being setup with a project folder, a [sample can be found here](https://github.com/JaneaSystems/nodejs-mobile-samples/tree/master/android/native-gradle-node-folder).


Move and integrate contents of this repo with your existing 
nodejs-mobile setup. Will add an automated 'build' process eventually...
